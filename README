mysqlwildfly contains scripts which packages the official mysql
connector from oracle as a wildfly module.

The scripts download the official mysql-connector jar from the mysql
website. The jar and the module metadata file, module.xml, are copied
into a wildfly module directory tree.

mktar.sh archives that tree using tar(1). Install the module by
extracting the tar in /opt/wildfly/modules/system/layers/base:

	cd /opt/wildfly/modules/system/layers/base
	tar xvzf wildfly-mysql-5.1.47.tar.gz

mkrpm.sh creates an rpm package using fpm. The rpm can be installed
 like any other rpm. For example using yum:

	yum install wildfly-mysql-5.1.47.rpm

A special note on fpm. fpm requires ruby. To install fpm, install the fpm
gem:

	gem install fpm

For more help on installing fpm see the project's documentation.
